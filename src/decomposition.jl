    ear_decomposition(g)

Return an Ear decomposition of the graph.

An ear of an undirected unweighted connected graph `G` is a path `P` where
the two endpoints of the path may coincide (i.e., form a cycle), but where
otherwise no repetition of edges or vertices is allowed, so every internal
vertex of `P` has degree two in `P`.

An ear decomposition of an undirected graph `G` is a partition of its
set of edges into a sequence of ears, such that the one or two endpoints
of each ear belong to earlier ears in the sequence and such that the
internal vertices of each ear do not belong to any earlier ear.

For more information, see the 
[Ear Decomposition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ear_decomposition)

It will throw an error if input graph is directed/disconnected graph. 

OUTPUT:
- A nested array(list) representing the cycles and chains of the ear
    decomposition of the graph.

### Performance
Time complexity of this algorithm is `O(N+M)`, where `N` is number of vertices
and `M` is number of edges.

### Examples
```jldoctest

julia> using LightGraphs

julia> elist = [(1,2),(2,3),(3,4),(4,1),(1,5), (1, 6), (6, 7), (7, 8), (1, 8)]

julia> g = SimpleGraph(8)

julia> for e in elist
    add_edge!(g, e[1], e[2])
end

julia> ear_decomposition(g)
2-element Array{Any,1}:
 [1, 4, 3, 2, 1]
 [1, 8, 7, 6, 1]
```
